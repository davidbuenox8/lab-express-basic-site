    <h1>Albums</h1>

        <p>The album received critical acclaim and won the 1995 Mercury Music Prize. It is often credited with
            popularising the trip hop genre, and is frequently cited in lists of the best albums of the 1990s. Dummy was

        <h2>Portishead(1997)</h2>
        <p>Portishead received critical acclaim upon its release. Spin praised the record and noted that the band
            created a "gothic", "deadly" and "trippy" atmosphere. Commenting on the textures of the music, music
            journalist Barry Walters observed that the group got "darker, deeper and more disturbing" in comparison to
            their previous effort Dummy</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Third(2008)</h2>
        <p> Described as an electronica, experimental rock and psychedelic rock record, Third departs from
            Portishead's trip hop sound, the genre they had popularised with their albums Dummy (1994) and Portishead
            (1997). It also contains no turntable scratching, a hallmark of their earlier albums. Gareth
            Grundy of Q wrote that "Third's sole link with the past is Gibbons' voice ... Everything else has been
            binned, the hip hop, the cinematic feel, the lot." Instead, the album contains "muscular" synthesisers,
            drum breaks and abrupt endings, with "propulsive" krautrock rhythms, break beats, cathedral organ,
            "Moroccan drones" and surf rock. The AV Club wrote that singer Gibbons "sounds more hollowed-out and
            harrowed than ever, a human nervous twitch on too much coffee and too little sleep".</p>
